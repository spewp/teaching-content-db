# Teaching Content Database - Frontend

## Minimalist Design

This frontend has been completely redesigned with a focus on simplicity, modern aesthetics, and maintainability.

### Key Features

- **Single CSS File**: All styling consolidated into `css/style.css`
- **Simplified HTML**: Clean, semantic structure in `index.html`
- **Single JavaScript File**: All functionality in `js/app.js`
- **Modern Design**: Clean whites, subtle grays, and a single blue accent color
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices
- **Fast Loading**: Minimal assets and optimized code

### File Structure

```
frontend/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── css/
│   └── style.css       # All styles in one file
└── js/
    └── app.js          # All JavaScript functionality
```

### Design Principles

1. **Minimalism**: Remove unnecessary elements and focus on core functionality
2. **Clarity**: Clean typography and plenty of white space
3. **Consistency**: Unified color scheme and spacing throughout
4. **Performance**: Fast loading with minimal HTTP requests
5. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper contrast ratios
